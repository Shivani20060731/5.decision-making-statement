# 5.decision-making-statement
Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements.

Tools Used: VS Code or Programiz Online Compiler

Theory:
This experiment shows how to use decision-making statements in C++ such as if-else and switch-case.

In the first program, the user enters a number, and the program checks if it is even or odd. It does this by checking if the number can be divided by 2 without a remainder. If it can, it’s even; otherwise, it’s odd.

The second program takes a character as input and checks whether it is a vowel or a consonant. The vowels are A, E, I, O, and U. The program checks both capital and small letters using logical conditions. If the letter is not a vowel, it is a consonant.

In the third program, the user enters three numbers, and the program finds out which number is the largest. It uses multiple if statements to compare the numbers and prints the biggest one.

The fourth program uses a switch-case structure inside a loop. It shows a menu with options to display personal information like name, date of birth, address, or college name. The user chooses a number from the menu to see the information. If the user enters 5, the program exits.

The fifth program is a simple calculator. It takes two numbers from the user and shows a menu to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Based on the user’s choice, it performs the operation using a switch-case and shows the result. If the choice is not valid, it shows an error message.

Conclusion:
By doing these programs, we learned how to use if, if-else, and switch-case to make decisions in a C++ program and how to create menu-driven applications.
